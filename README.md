Ten Oaks Project Data Integration
=================================

This tool was created for the Ten Oaks Project at the Random Hacks of Kindness Ottawa hackathon in June 2016.
Ten Oaks wanted something to automatically take their donation data from CanadaHelps and copy it to Salesforce, a process which was being done manually.

(Note: Although CanadaHelps has a Connector for Salesforce, apparently it does not work well for them)
